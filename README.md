# Thesis2024
Masters's thesis of Applied Data Science 2023-2024. The research question of the thesis is: 'Does it pay to serve the public? Drivers of user engagement in a Video On Demand platform of a Public Broadcaster Service'.

The data collection, preparation and exploration has been performed in Python (Google Cloud Console - BigQuery to be precise). The multiple linear regression has been performed in R due to statistical knowledge in this context. It is therefore a separate file, which can be (but does not have to be) 'knitted' to an html after downloading.

Regarding the data, only the file from the KNMI is shared, but can also be downloaded on https://daggegevens.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens. The file KNMI_info contains its metadata. Other data is not shared due to legal issues. However, previews can be seen on GitHub since these do not contain any personal data.
